Hexadecimal Sudoku Solver for ICS 211

A homework assignment for my ICS 211 course. The assignment focused on implementing a recusive backtracking algorithm in order to solve 16x16 Hexadecimal Sudoku Puzzles. A majority of the set-up for this project was done by the professor for the course. The students were tasked with implementing the *solveSudoku* and *legalValues* functions in *HexadecimalSudoku.java*.
